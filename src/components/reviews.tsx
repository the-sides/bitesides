<h2 className="!mt-0">Milk and Honey</h2>
<p>Hodgepodge Hash - mid as shit. Creme too powerful.</p>
<p>BLAT. extremely solid</p>
<p>Coffee is amazing.</p>
<p>AIGHT WE Come here the most</p>
<p>J: 9/10</p>
<p>V: 9/10</p>

<h2>Mezcla Cocina Y Cantina</h2>
<p>Overpriced but still good imo. Tamales were solid.</p>
<p>They were busy and the food took forever. And they forgot my beer but the waitress was so nice, I wasn't upset.</p>

<h2>Two Ten Jack</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The spicy crab was good, but could've used something else. Felt like something you'd get from an Italian restaurant. Wish I had more of the tonkatsu</li>
  <li>The tonkotsu was very good, the broth was fantastic</li>
  <li>mochi - tested similar to TJ's with the gummyness, but the icecream was sturdier. Much preferred, thought it was good.</li>
  <li>8/10</li>
</ul>

<h2>BOCCACCIA</h2>
<p>We got <strong>Bruschetta</strong> and the three pieces were fantastic.</p>
<p>We both got a lemoncello martini and thought there were fantastic, only wish I had more.</p>
<p>I got the</p>
<h3>Orecchiette con Salsiccia alla Piemontese</h3>
<p>Dome shaped pasta with braised Italian sausage and fresh goat cheese</p>
<p>And should have savored each bite more. It was fantastic.</p>
<p>Vicki got the</p>
<p><strong>Linguine Veneziani</strong> and while it wasn't my favorite, the scallops were particularly good and she liked it.</p>
<p>You could tell the food was extremely fresh and mostly made in house. The waiter had mentioned that prep had started 12 hours before the restaurant was opened, at 5pm</p>
<p>9/10</p>

<h2>Il Primo</h2>
<p>It's honestly a tough call between this and boccacia. The drinks and bruschetta (which you assembled with a melted cheese blocks and tomatoes) where arguably better. I liked the meal I had at boccacia between but Vicki was obsessed with her fish. "I would fuck that fish, it was the best I've ever had in my life."</p>
<p>I got the shrimp fra diavolo and honestly wasn't too impressed</p>
<p>8/10 from me but a 10/10 from Vicki.</p>

<h2>Osaka</h2>
<p>I had gotten the hibachi shrimp steak and chicken fried rice. That was pretty good. It was a lot of food very filling. The vegetables were good. It steak was cooked to a good quality when you're getting appetizers. Vicky had a rainbow roll with miso soup while the miso soup was average. The rainbow roll I believe I as in Vicky believes it used invitation crab and was not as good as other sushi locations. Also the doctor pepper was not good at all</p>

<h2>Kenny's</h2>
<p>Beautiful building, lots of rooms to sit in. Interior decorating and illustrations aided in the simple and classy aesthetic.</p>
<p>Beignet are fuckin bomb, V said 10/10, very light and fluffy. Better than Ruby Tuesday (a literal New Orleans restaurant)</p>
<p>Bacon was smokey</p>
<p>V offered her pickle. I hate pickles. She is very funny..</p>
<p>She also doesn't understand history.</p>
<p>She thought women didn't have rights in 1970.</p>

<h2>Buffalo Wild Wings</h2>
<p>"Shit my pants. Smelly shit. Smelly wings. No Vicki no. Don't go. Tater tots were BAMMM JAMMM THANK YOU MAN tho."</p>
<p>"Bitch didn't know difference from DP and P."</p>

<h2>Talupa Honey</h2>
<p>Mimosas were good. V really liked the apple cider mimosa, but I thought it was too sweet.</p>
<p>"The mimosas was slap yo mama in the face with fall"</p>
<p>"The coffee was meh" but as far as a mocha it was better than most.</p>
<p>I got the smothered biscuit and I felt the biscuit was undercooked, but the insides were good enough.</p>
<p>Chicken and waffles: v gave the chicken a 6, but the waffle a 9</p>
<p>The mimosa flight was original, idk if V would've found the apple cider otherwise.</p>
<p>J gives it: 6/10</p>
<p>V gives it: 6.5/10</p>
<p>Having gone again later, we both move to 7.5</p>

<h2>Amigos</h2>
<p>Somehow our favorite, but the food is not god tier. The 2 for 1 frozen marg value is bomb</p>
<p>10/10 for drinks</p>
<p>8/10 for food.</p>

<h2>Community Pie</h2>
<p>Lol the second time we came. The first time, we sat for 10-15 mins before leaving.</p>
<p>Lemochello. Shots were good.</p>
<p>Brushette. Felt pretty americanized to me, but the arugula was separated (which is good bc V didn't want it). Very filling.</p>

<h2>Honey Seed</h2>
